M P O R T A N T  S C H O O L  M E M O R A N D A\n2007 VPLS Memo on the Dress Code\nIMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES ON THE LOYOLA SCHOOLS DRESS CODE\nAlthough no uniform is prescribed in the Loyola Schools, it is the responsibility of the students to \ndress in a manner that is modest and appropriate to the academic nature of the university. (The Code \nof Discipline Section I. A)\nWhile the way we dress is a form of self-expression, it also reﬂects our values and attitudes.\n1.\nDressing simply puts focus on the substance, rather than the form, of the person. \nIn a Filipino, Catholic, and Jesuit University, simple dress acknowledges the social responsibility \nof every member of the community to address the problem of the socio- economic gap between \nthe privileged and the underprivileged. It means avoiding extravagance or the ostentatious use of \nluxury items.\n2.\nDressing appropriately means clothes that reﬂect the purpose of the activity… \nThus, clothes or footwear for places like the beach, bedroom, or gym (e.g., slippers, \nlounging/gym/athletic shorts and tops, cycling shorts, short shorts, sleeveless shirts for men), \nwhen worn during academic activities, do not reﬂect the respect for the institutional culture and \npersons of the university.\n3.\nDressing decently is a sign of respect for the human body. \nIn the culture of a Catholic university, revealing and sloppy clothes do not reﬂect this respect. \nThese include, among others, low-cut/backless/strapless blouses, very low-rise jeans, bare \nmidriff, short shorts, soiled clothes, and lounging shorts/tops.\nThese guidelines are to be strictly observed by all members of the Loyola Schools community \nat:\n1.\nAll oﬃcial functions and events of and in the Ateneo de Manila University, including \ncommencement, convocations, conferences, receptions, and assemblies;\n2.\nThe oﬃces of all Ateneo administrators, as well as any meetings, appointments, or \ntransactions with Ateneo administrators outside of their oﬃces;\n3.\nAll Xavier Hall oﬃces, including corridors and waiting areas;\n4.\nThe Rizal Library;\n5.\nThe Registrar’s Oﬃce;\n6.\nAll events and activities in major Audio-Visual Rooms, such as the Irwin Theater, Faura AVR, \nEscaler Hall, and Leong Hall Auditorium;\n7.\nAll functions, events, and activities where the Ateneo de Manila University is represented, \nexcept those that clearly require other attire, such as in sports tournaments.\nThe Schools or Departments may also issue more speciﬁc guidelines to be enforced within their \narea of jurisdiction\n, as stated in Article IV, Section\n6 of the Magna Carta of Undergraduate Student \nRights.

Considering the diverse nature of activities organized and participated in by students at \ndifferent academic levels, the respective units of the University may set higher standards which they may \ndeem proper for the safety and protection of the students.\nII. Deﬁnition of Terms\nThe following terms used in these Guidelines shall be deﬁned as follows:\nA.\nOff-campus activities—\noﬃcial and authorized activities\nwhich include curricular and non-curricular \nactivities undertaken within the Philippines but outside the premises of the Ateneo de Manila \nUniversity.\nB.\nOff-campus curricular activities—\nrequired off-campus\nactivities, including co-curricular activities, that \nare a part of the instructional program that all students are expected to attend.

Statement of Principles \nand Guidelines Against Proﬁteering\nThe Ateneo de Manila, Loyola Schools, is a Filipino, Jesuit, Catholic, tertiary-level educational institution \nthat provides access to performances, concerts, athletic events, exhibits, and instructional opportunities, \nto members of our community in consonance with educational goals. These are offered to expand the \nmind beyond the classroom, to enhance school spirit, foster camaraderie, and generally enrich the College \nexperience.\nAs such, may the community ﬁnd guidance in the following:\n1.\nParticipation in the aforementioned (whether as host, entrepreneur, patron, buyer or reseller) \nshould always remain consistent with school values, among them—Integrity, Fairness, Social \nJustice and Ethical Consumption.\n2.\nEngaging in any form of proﬁteering is contrary to the nature of the Ateneo, especially as regards \ntransactions, events, or products related to or available through the school. Members of the \ncommunity are therefore encouraged to report any activity of this like, and evidence of such, to \nthe Oﬃce of Student Services.\n3.\nThese opportunities (concretized in the form of UAAP games and tickets, concert passes, seats \nto plays and musicals, etc.) are not to be treated as “goods” which can be privately owned and \ntherefore resold for proﬁt. If one suddenly ﬁnds one’s self unable to take advantage of an \nopportunity already availed, what is acceptable is to allow it to transfer to someone who can, at \nthe cost of acquisition.\n4.\nNeither should members of the community allow themselves to be contracted by people who \nseek to make a proﬁt from said events, or wish to circumvent implemented measures to ensure \nequitable distribution of such opportunities.

As administrative processes, they are not \nsubject to the rules of court.\n7\n2.7.\nIn addition to the counsel, one other person (e.g., parent or family member) may be present \nas an observer during the personal testimony of the respondent at the hearing, upon written \nor verbal notice to the Committee Chair. They may not address the person giving testimony \nor the Committee during his/her oral testimony, nor give testimony themselves. However, \nobservers may submit their sentiments regarding the case in writing, prior to the hearing, \nfor inclusion in the case ﬁle to be evaluated by the Committee. Any concerns about the \nconduct of the hearing itself may likewise be submitted in writing to the Chair of the \nCommittee on Discipline after the proceedings. Observers may be removed from the \nhearing if they fail to follow these guidelines.\n2.8.\nAfter questioning the parties and witnesses, the Committee shall deliberate on the case \nand determine whether or not the student is guilty of the offense as charged. Appropriate \nsanctions will also be deliberated on, along with any mitigating or aggravating factors, if the \nstudent is found guilty.\n2.9.\nThe Committee shall thereafter submit its ﬁndings and recommendations in writing to the \nAssociate Dean for Student Formation.\n3.\nSanctions/Obligations for Major Offenses\nMajor offenses shall warrant one or a combination of the following sanctions:\n3.1.\nany of those listed as penalties for minor offenses\n3.2.\nmandatory work in the form of community service\n3.3.\nloss of privileges related to the nature of the offense\n3.4.\ndisciplinary probation (\nﬁrst warning\nor\nﬁnal warning\nstatus)\n8\n8\nFor “Probation,\nFirst\nWarning Status”:\nAny future\nviolation of the\nCode of Conduct\n, whether deemed\na minor violation or a major \noffense, during the duration of probation, will merit a higher sanction in reference to the nature of the case and/or the sanctions\n7\nJacinto D.

on Alcohol Consumption \nin the University Premises\nMemo of the Vice President for Administration and Human Resources (6 December 2019)\nThe season of Christmas is a time of merry-making. As much as we would like to celebrate the festive \nperiod to the fullest, we would like to remind the community on the Policy on Alcohol Consumption in the \nUniversity Premises.\nObjectives:\nThe policy seeks to encourage social responsibility and appropriate behavior in the consumption of \nalcohol; and ensure that the consumption of alcohol in University premises consider the following:\n1.\nThat the laws of the Philippines governing the sale/consumption of alcohol will at all times be \nobserved.\n2.\nThat the consumption of alcohol by people on University premises will, in all circumstances, \nrecognize the rights of others and will not be promoted or fostered as an end in itself.\n3.\nThat the provision of alcohol on University premises will be subject to the availability of \nappropriate and suitable facilities.\nScope:\nAll employees, students and users of any venue for an oﬃcial/authorized function in the University.\nPolicy Guidelines on Alcohol Consumption in University Premises:\n1.\nThe sale of alcohol in any facility owned or managed by the University is prohibited.\n2.\nExcept for instances noted below, no alcohol may be served, displayed, or consumed in any \nUniversity open space or in any University building.\n3.\nAlcohol may be served/sold only at by-invitation-only functions. It is the responsibility of the host \nor administrative unit hosting the event to comply fully with the University's guidelines on alcohol.\n4.\nExcept for University holidays, no alcohol may be served at any campus location on a weekday \nuntil after 5:00 p.m. Only the Vice President for Administration and Human Resources or his \ndesignate may authorize an exception to this provision.\n5.\nIt is a violation of Philippine law to serve alcohol to anyone under 18 years of age. University \nadministrative units planning functions that are likely to be attended by students under 18 are \nstrongly discouraged from serving any alcohol to anyone at such functions. If the unit plans to \nserve alcohol at a function that will be attended by guests under the age of 18, the unit must \nsubmit, as part of the approval process, an explanation of the method by which it will determine \nwhich guests are over 18 and how it will assure that guests under 18 are not served.\n6.\nThe following guidelines must be strictly followed by the organizers of functions where alcohol \nwill be served:\n6.1.\nAccess to the event must be limited to invitees and controlled throughout the event.

of Conduct for Students\n1\nI n t r o d u c t i o n\nThe Code of Conduct provides the basic framework of normative rules to facilitate the total formation of \nstudents\naccording to the Christian ideal of the human\nperson, an individual imbued with dignity inherent \nin his/her being an image and likeness of God\n. It\nembodies the Loyola Schools’ commitment to facilitating \nthe development of students’ moral character and personal discipline. Animated by Ignatian principles and \npedagogy, this Code of Conduct aims at engaging students in the world, following from the belief that we \ncan ﬁnd God in all things.\nThe succeeding list of responsibilities, procedures, offenses and sanctions contains the modes of conduct \nconducive to the creation of an Ateneo academic community committed to and consistent with the \nfundamental values of honesty, fairness, integrity and justice.\nI .  B a s i c  R e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes their continuing development as \npersons, as well as the continuing development of their peers. They have a responsibility to ensure that \nthe academic environment of the Loyola Schools is wholesome and conducive to human formation.\nA.\nAlthough no uniform is prescribed in the Loyola Schools, it is the responsibility of the students to \ndress in a manner that is modest and appropriate to the academic nature of the university.\nB.\nStudents are required to wear their Identiﬁcation (ID) Cards on campus and present the same \nwhenever requested by university personnel.\nC.\nStudents are expected to follow classroom policies and procedures set by the school and their \nteachers. A teacher may send a student out of class for misbehavior. The student is then marked \nabsent.\nD.\nStudents are to behave and express themselves responsibly in the use of communication and \ninformation technology, especially when engaging in any action that may impact on the privacy, \ndignity, and/or rights of institutions, groups or individuals, including themselves.\nE.\nCommunication and information technology equipment cannot be used in the classroom without the \nexplicit permission of the teacher.\nF.\nStudents are required to keep their contact and personal information on AISIS (Ateneo Integrated \nStudent Information System) up-to-date. Students will be held responsible for instances where they \ncannot be contacted for this reason.\nG.\nWhile students are encouraged to participate in off-campus activities, especially those that are \ncultural and educational in nature, students are expected to conduct themselves properly in such \nfunctions and to use the name of the University responsibly.

Students who have not resolved their \ndisciplinary cases or have inadequately served their sanctions will not be cleared for enrollment, \ntransfer or graduation\n.\n16\nHold orders may be issued\nfor these reasons.\nB.\nThe oﬃcial issuer of Certiﬁcates of Good Moral Character (CGMCs) for the LS is the Oﬃce of \nStudent Discipline (OSD).\n1.\nStandard CGMCs are issued to applicants who have had no record of any major offense for \nthe entirety of their stay at the Loyola Schools.\n2.\nStudents who have clean records, but are subject to an active disciplinary inquiry at the time \nof their CGMC application may be issued a provisional certiﬁcation indicating a clear record \nother than an ongoing disciplinary inquiry. Students may re-apply for the standard CGMC after \nthe inquiry is resolved, if there is no ﬁnding of a case or culpability for a major offense.\n3.\nViolations deemed “minor” do not prevent applicants from receiving a Certiﬁcate of Good \nMoral Character.\n4.\nQualiﬁed CGMCs may be issued to applicants who have been found guilty in a major \ndisciplinary case, but have since satisﬁed all sanctions and conditions related to that offense, \nhave accepted responsibility for their actions, and do not have any other disciplinary case, \npending or resolved, as of the date of application. The text of the QCGMC informs the \nreceiving institution of these, along with the recommendation that, given what he/she has \nlearned from the experience, it may be reasonable to give the applicant a chance to prove \nhis/her worth with their institution. Students who have been sanctioned with \nnon-readmission, dismissal or expulsion cannot be issued QCGMCs.\n17\n5.\nPermanent disqualiﬁcation from being issued a CGMC may be a consequence of disciplinary \nproceedings after multiple offenses or for serious major offenses.

Student Guide \nto the Code of Academic Integrity \nof the Loyola Schools\n(2021 EDITION)\nS e c t i o n  1 :\nT h e  C o r e  P r i n c i p l e s\nThe Ateneo de Manila University, realizing that the\npreservation, extension, and communication of truth\nis \nnecessary for dignifying the human person and community, seeks to\neducate the whole person\nby \nrespecting academic integrity in all aspects of Ateneo life.\nGiven this identity of the University, every member of the Loyola Schools community is tasked to become \nnot just\nintellectually excellent,\nbut\nmorally virtuous\nas well. This is accomplished by honing\nsapientia\net \neloquentia—\nthinking and communicating one’s thoughts—always\nin the spirit of honesty.\nOnly through this can\nmagis\nbe achieved. Truth is\nfundamental for identifying and doing what is most \nnecessary for the common good.\nOnly through this can\ncura personalis\nbe practiced.\nHonesty is necessary for personal dignity to be \ncultivated.\nUltimately,\njustice\nis truth lived out in the context\nof the community. It is only in truth that we can truly \nform\nprofessionals for others\n—agents of justice who\nserve others by respecting, promoting and defending \nthe dignity of the human person, in word and work, and thus contribute toward the development of the \nnation.\nS e c t i o n  2 :\nS t u d e n t  R e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s  a s  r e g a r d s \nt h e  p r e s e r v a t i o n  &  d e f e n s e  o f  a c a d e m i c  i n t e g r i t y\nThere can be no intellectual life without academic integrity. Thus, it is fundamental that both students and \nprofessors be thoroughly truthful in all their academic efforts/work, in recognition of the potential effects \nof individual acts on the culture and mores of the community. Students play a vital role in shaping the \ncommunity through their academic participation. The following responsibilities will aid students in \nensuring the commitment to academic integrity:\n1.\nStudents should ensure that all submitted work, both individual and group, is the product of their own \nactions, reﬂection and learning.\n1.1.\nHigher education requires that one go beyond mere repetition of facts or opinions of others. \nAlthough one will be exposed to many points of view in the learning process, it is incumbent \nupon the student, while rooted in the assigned work, to bring one’s own questions, concerns, and \ninsights into the experience.\n2.\nThere can be no academic integrity where commitment and rigor are absent. As much as academic \nintegrity involves adherence to principles, it also requires attention to the seemingly minute details of \ngiving acknowledgment where it is due.\nWhen one does make use of external sources:\n2.1.\nNo matter what the source, it is the student’s responsibility to give\ncomplete\nand\naccurate\ncredit \nwhere credit is due.\nStudents are responsible for making themselves aware of and adept at the appropriate \nconvention of documentation for the particular ﬁeld in which they are working.\nL O Y O L A  S C H O O L S  U N D E R G R A D U A T E  S T U D E N T  H A N D B O O K\nV O L U M E\n2\n17	{"source": "/root/assistant/var/contexts/prefect/LS Undergraduate Student Handbook 2022 Volume 2.pdf", "page": 16}	94b7b5b5-dff3-11ed-b3bf-971b7605698d

of the Ateneo education is learning to be thankful to others for what one learns, which is \nshown by proper attribution of the source, because it enables the student to contribute further to \nthe ﬁeld of knowledge.\n2.2.\nExternal sources should enrich, not substitute for, one’s ideas.\n3.\nIn opportunities for cooperative learning (as with group work/study) students must always be mindful \nof\nboth\ntheir own individual contribution,\nand the\nﬁnal communal outcome.\n4.\nOne’s intellectual work should be valued as a part of one’s self. As such, one should not allow it to be \nused by others in a dishonest manner.\n5.\nActs of dishonesty weaken the community of learners by corroding the trust that binds the \ncommunity together. Each member of the LS bears the responsibility for responding to suspected \nacts of academic dishonesty through appropriate channels.\nS e c t i o n  3 :\nA c t s  o f  A c a d e m i c  D i s h o n e s t y\nD e ﬁ n i t i o n  a n d  E x a m p l e s  \nThe following section elaborates on the different types of academic dishonesty based on those \nenumerated in the\nCode of Conduct\nof the Student Handbook.\nAfter each explanation are examples of \nsome instances that constitute offenses in that category. While these sample cases are not meant to be \nexhaustive, they aim to give readers a concrete understanding of acts that violate the standards of the \nLoyola Schools.\nA .

Dishonest behavior \ncan take many forms, as enumerated but not limited to those mentioned here.\nUnless explicitly allowed by the instructor, the following behavior is unacceptable and will be construed as \n“academic dishonesty” whether actual cheating occurred:\n1.\nAny form of unauthorized communication\nSample Case 1:\nTwo students were found talking after\nthe test papers had already been \npassed out.

Case 4\n: A student found the answers left by the previous class on the computer he \naccessed for a practical exam, and used some of it.\nSample Case 5\n: A student kept tapping the chair of\nthe person seated in front of him, \npurportedly just to ask for the current date and their section.\n4.\nMaking one’s test paper visible to others\nSample Case 6\n: A student was asked by his friend before\nclass for help with a diﬃcult part of \nthe test. While he did not agree to it explicitly, during the exam, he let his seatmate copy off \nhis paper.\n5.\nPossession, or presence attributed to the person, and/or use of unauthorized notes of any materials \nor equipment that may have relevance or usefulness to the subject of an ongoing examination, or that \nmay be used in a dishonest act. \nSample Case 7\n: While roaming around the classroom,\na teacher noticed a piece of paper fall \nfrom a student’s desk. It contained notes the student made for the subject. The student \nclaimed, however, that she did not use them. She just forgot to put them away after doing \nsome last minute reviewing before the test papers were distributed.\nSample Case 8:\nTowards the end of an exam, a teacher\nnoticed a student using her cellphone. \nWhen admonished, the student reasoned that she had ﬁnished answering the test already and \nwas checking for an urgent message.\nSample Case 9:\nA teacher became suspicious of a student\nwho had his collar up during an \nexam. When he approached the student, he discovered that the student had earphones on. \nThe student claimed that he only used it to block out the noise.\nNote for Students:\nAll exams, whether written or oral,\ntake-home or in-class, should be taken seriously as an \nevaluative tool for determining what was learned by each individual student. As a general rule,\ndo NOT \nengage in any behavior that raises doubts about the validity of the results of your exam—\ne.g. as with \naccess to the assistance of others and/or the presence of tools that could have placed you in a position \nofunfair advantage.\n✔\nRead test instructions/guidelines very carefully and follow them strictly. Come early so you don’t \nget ﬂustered and miss out on instructions/reminders.\n✔\nEspecially if you know you will be tempted to take your phone out if it starts vibrating, make sure \nit is not on your person and turn it off for the duration of the test/class.\n✔\nOnce a test has started, any form of communication can put you and your classmate in a \nquestionable position. Instead of asking a friend, all queries and communication should be \ncoursed through the teacher/proctor.\n✔\nYou need to be aware of, and take personal responsibility for, any actions that may become \nproblematic for you or others during an exam (e.g. like a predisposition for whispering, gesturing, \nor moving about during tests).\n✔\nIn case of health/family emergencies that may affect testing conditions or your fulﬁllment of \nguidelines, always ask your teacher/proctor for help.\nL O Y O L A  S C H O O L S  U N D E R G R A D U A T E  S T U D E N T  H A N D B O O K\nV O L U M E\n2\n19	{"source": "/root/assistant/var/contexts/prefect/LS Undergraduate Student Handbook 2022 Volume 2.pdf", "page": 18}	94b7b5b7-dff3-11ed-b3bf-971b7605698d

.  P l a g i a r i s m\nPlagiarism is an offense that generally strikes at two important educational values—the value of hard \nwork and respect for others’ intellectual property. When a person fails to give credit to a source, thereby \ngiving the impression that a borrowed idea or way of saying things is one’s own, he/she commits \nplagiarism. Speciﬁcally, it can take the following forms:\n1. Verbatim repetition of someone else’s words without acknowledgement;\n2. Presentation of someone else’s ideas without acknowledgement;\n3. Paraphrasing, translating, or summarizing someone else’s ideas without acknowledgement;\n4. Improper acknowledgement of sources, as with incomplete/imprecise documentation;\n5. Having one’s work done by someone else or having one’s work substantially revised by someone \nelse.\nIt is important to remember that\nplagiarism is identiﬁed\nnot through intent but through the act itself\n.\nThe \nobjective act of falsely attributing to one’s self what is not one’s work, whether intentional or out of \nneglect, is suﬃcient to conclude that plagiarism has occurred. Students who plead ignorance or appeal to \nlack of malice are not excused. The extent of the plagiarism, whether an entire paper, a single paragraph \nor a phrase, does not matter; nor does the occasion, whatever the academic requirement (research paper, \ntests, reports, oral presentation, power point slides, computer programs, illustrations, creative work, etc.). \nPlagiarism is not restricted to print sources.\nPlagiarism, at its core, is an ethical question rather than a legal one.\nTo claim that a work is in the\npublic \ncirculation (e.g. internet) or that permission to use the words or ideas has been granted does not erase \nthe moral imperative for one to acknowledge sources.\nSample Case 1:\nSince a student was having diﬃculty\nexpressing herself in the given language, \nshe decided to take the words in an online article as her own.\nNote for students\n: It can be tempting to resort to\n(copy-paste) plagiarism out of a lack of conﬁdence in \nyour own ability to express yourselﬁn the language required. Many mention the diﬃculties in meeting \nexpectations, and the pressure to produce something at par with everyone else.\n✔\nStumbling around with what you want to say is normal. The writing process is not supposed to \nbe easy, as it involves the process of trying to ﬁnd your own voice as you throw ideas around.\n✔\nAsk your teacher if it’s possible to write in your preferred language. Some may agree if it helps \nyou express your ideas better.\n✔\nIf you Google the topic or question given for a paper before you even know what your own \nthoughts are independent of what you might read, you may end up painting yourself into a corner \nwhen you read from someone else what you think you want to say.\n✔\nRather than opt for the easy way out (e.g. copying what other people say), which will undercut \nwhat you should be learning in the ﬁrst place, embrace the challenges which are meant to help \nyour skills expand, your abilities to grow, and your character to form.\nSample Case 2\n: A student claimed that since he changed\nsome of the original words of a text \nand the basic sentence construction, it was no longer necessary to credit the source.\nNote for students\n: Paraphrasing correctly can be tricky.\nSimply substituting synonyms or the \nsubject-predicate order of the original does NOT remove the imperative to acknowledge your source/s.\nL O Y O L A  S C H O O L S  U N D E R G R A D U A T E  S T U D E N T  H A N D B O O K\nV O L U M E\n2\n20	{"source": "/root/assistant/var/contexts/prefect/LS Undergraduate Student Handbook 2022 Volume 2.pdf", "page": 19}	94b7b5b8-dff3-11ed-b3bf-971b7605698d

if you’re citing “plain facts” (e.g. the description of a company, the process of climate \nchange, the deﬁnition of drug dependence, etc.), stating where you got this from (e.g. \n“According to the oﬃcial website of product X,”“Given the World Health Organization’s deﬁnition \nof…”, etc.), is not only necessary, but good for the credibility of your paper.\n✔\nAsk for help from your teacher before using an existing text/previous work as a “template”, so \nas to avoid misunderstandings, and to clarify the expected academic output.\nSample Case 3:\nA student reasoned that she thought\nthat a footnote at the last sentence of \nan entire paragraph based on someone else’s idea was suﬃcient.\nNote for students\n: A footnote or parenthetical reference\nonly refers to the sentence immediately \npreceding it.\n✔\nIf you’re taking an entire paragraph verbatim from a source, you need to use a block quote (a \nseparate indented paragraph with its own citation)\n✔\nIf the material taken verbatim from a source is less than a paragraph, but more than a sentence \nlong, use quotation marks (“”) for the entire lifted text (along with the proper \nfootnote/endnote/parenthetical remark) to indicate that all the material within them is taken \nverbatim from somewhere else.\n✔\nWithout the use of quotation marks, or a block quote, a person reading your paper will think you \ncame up with the words yourself. That would be dishonest even if those words encapsulate \nwhat you indeed wanted to say—because the phrasing is someone else’s, and the omission of \nthe direct credit diminishes the hard work of the actual author.\n✔\nQuotation marks, or a block quote, by themselves, without the appropriate footnote/end \nnote/parenthetical remark pointing to a source that is listed in the references section, is also \ninadequate. Poor references will also disable others from verifying and building on your work, \nwhich is a core value in the academe.\nSample Case 4:\nPrior to the defense of a student’s\nresearch paper, when the reader examined \nthe paper, he found that the footnoted sentences do not pertain to the sources cited.\nNote for students\n: Rigor is part and parcel of academic\nintegrity. Even without any intent to deceive, it is \nyour responsibility as a student not to be sloppy in your work.\n✔\nDouble check your sources before passing a paper to your teacher. Keeping your external \nsources organized will go a long way to making this easier. Attributions are useless if they point \nto the wrong source.\nSample Case 5:\nA teacher discovered that a student’s\nsubmission of a 1-page bonus paper \nshe had given those who wanted to pull up their grades was largely taken from someone \nelse’s essay.\nNote for students\n: Take note that ANY assessable requirement\n(i.e. anything you submit) is subject to the \nstandards of academic integrity. While the standards in this Code are school-wide, some teachers may \narticulate more stringent requirements given certain contexts (e.g. a thesis-writing class compared to a \nfreshman English composition class).

sure you know and understand the standards of academic integrity speciﬁc to a particular \nclass.\n✔\nAsk questions at the start of the semester if there is something you do not understand or \ndisagree with in the class policies. You can bring it up to the Chair of the department if need be.\n \nSample Case 6\n: A student decided to copy the line\nof argument of a source for a reﬂection \npaper, although he changed some of the wording.\nNote for students\n: Plagiarism is not limited to the\nparroting of words. It encompasses the totality of the \nauthor’s intellectual work—including how he/she framed the question, how he/she developed the thesis, \nas well as his/her style of writing.\n✔\nThe bottom line isto give credit where credit is due. Acknowledging an author’s frame, which you \nthen adapted for your purpose, would have been more acceptable.\nSample Case 7:\nA student asked a friend who she knew\nto be a good writer to edit her \nreﬂection paper. When the revised paper was sent back to her, she was so happy with the \nimprovements and passed it as is, failing to realize that the paper included the reﬂections of \nthe editor.\nNote for students\n: There is a difference between asking\nsomeone to check your grammar,versus letting \nthem affect the substance of your paper.\n✔\nIf it is necessary to ask for assistance, make sure to check that the identity of the work as a \nproduct of YOUR OWN learning is not compromised.\nSample Case 8:\nA teacher found that a student lifted\na few sentences of a ﬁve-page essay \nfrom a source without credit. The student reasoned that this is not plagiarism because it falls \nunder the threshold score given by the teacher of 15% for the similarity index of Turnitin\n18\nNote for students\n: While there are degrees of plagiarism,\nand some cases are certainly worse than others \n(e.g. wholesale copying of papers), plagiarizing a little is still plagiarism.\n✔\nNote that Turnitin only provides a Similarity Index. It merely points out what in the submitted text is \nsimilar to material that is already in its database. It will say that sentence 1 in submission X, is the \nsame as a sentence in source Y. It cannot detect that sentence 1 has adequate quotation marks, \nwith an appropriate footnote to source Y. By itself, it cannot tell the difference between a properly \nsourced paper and the same paper lacking its citations.\n✔\nA high similarity score in Turnitin, if all sources are legitimately acknowledged within the text and in \nthe bibliography, can constitute a plagiarism-free submission (although a teacher can deem the \npaper unﬁt in other aspects such as amount of original output). Similarly, a low similarity score \ndoes NOT mean that a paper is free of plagiarism (any unattributed material can put the paper into \nquestion).\n18\nSee appendix for FAQs regarding\nTurnitin\nL O Y O L A  S C H O O L S  U N D E R G R A D U A T E  S T U D E N T  H A N D B O O K\nV O L U M E\n2\n22	{"source": "/root/assistant/var/contexts/prefect/LS Undergraduate Student Handbook 2022 Volume 2.pdf", "page": 21}	94b7b5ba-dff3-11ed-b3bf-971b7605698d

there is something questionable in your submission, talk to your teacher and politely ask \nhim/her to explain the basis of their assessment. Explain your writing process and ask how you \ncould have done better.\nSample Case 9:\nFor a computer programming assignment,\na student copied existing code on \nthe internet and just changed the subject. In another class, a student submitted “original \nartwork” that had clear aesthetic similarities to the existent work of another artist, which she \nused as a “peg” when she started.\nNote for students\n: Plagiarism is not conﬁned to papers.\nIn the sciences, for example, it often refers to the \nmisappropriation of work processes or ideas. In the arts it can apply to falsely laying claim to creative \nwork.\n✔\nConsult with your teacher prior to submission, show your sources and ask for advice if you feel \nstuck.\nSample Case 10\n: When a student failed to attend the\nﬁlm showing in class, she decided to \njust submit a reaction paper based on the online reviews she found about the topic.\nNote for students\n: Apart from plagiarizing the online\nreviews, the entire paper in this case is a matter \nof deception if she had not watched the ﬁlm herself.\nThe vicarious process of insight, if not disclosed, is dishonest since there was no actual experience \nto base the reaction on. Even if you were successfully able to restate the ideas of others into your \nown words, and you attribute quotations and paraphrases accurately, it is misrepresentation to \nportray the submission as having been based on the assigned task when it was not.\n✔\nIf you have a valid reason for missing the activity, ask your teacher for alternatives on how to \nproceed with the requirement in question\nSample Case 11\n: A student did not cite the text he\nused during an open-notes exam.\nNote for students\n: Whether the assignment is done\nin class, outside of class, for a short or extensive \namount of time, with open notes or not, if an idea comes from someone else, give credit to your source.\n✔\nDepending on the resources you are allowed to bring for the academic requirement, even partial \ncredit (e.g. “According to our class reading on ___”) is better than nothing.\n✔\nClarify evaluation standards if you are confused about whether to mention a source or not.\nSample Case 12:\nFor group work, one member contributed\nplagiarized material for his part, \nthrough the group’s use of Google Docs. In the ﬁnal compilation of the parts for submission, \nthe group included the plagiarized material since each person only looked at their own part, \nwithout being critical of the paper as a whole.\n \nNote for students\n: Depending on whether the different\ngroup members were aware of the plagiarized \nsubmission, or were in a position to know, persons other than the author of the plagiarized piece may be \ncharged with the same offense. While there are degrees of culpability, it would be good to remember that \nit is each student’s duty to be circumspect of everything that you put your name on.\nL O Y O L A  S C H O O L S  U N D E R G R A D U A T E  S T U D E N T  H A N D B O O K\nV O L U M E\n2\n23	{"source": "/root/assistant/var/contexts/prefect/LS Undergraduate Student Handbook 2022 Volume 2.pdf", "page": 22}	94b7b5bb-dff3-11ed-b3bf-971b7605698d

that group work is NOT about coming up with a patchwork of disparate parts. It’s \nabout several people collaborating for output that they presumably could not have produced \nalone. Effectively, the whole should be greater than a mere sum of its parts.\n✔\nIn the digital age, it is especially tempting for groups to dismiss the need to actually meet in \nperson because of programs like Google Docs that let people work ‘simultaneously’ on the same \npaper, while being in different places. Because of how easily things can get lost in that process, \nyou actually have to be extra careful that nothing is neglected.\n✔\nEven if you have a group editor, everybody needs to read the whole paper prior to submission. \nThe mistake of one will affect the grade of the rest, sometimes seriously so.\n✔\nThe usual red ﬂags to watch out for in checking each other’s work include sudden changes in \nwriting style, unnatural speed of production or length of text, and excessive details.\n✔\nMost of the time, this problem is tied to having crammed the requirement in the ﬁrst place, so \none clear way to avoid accidental submission of plagiarized material is to work early enough so \nthat everyone can go through the paper carefully.\nSample Case 13:\nA group borrowed an old business plan\nfrom a previous school year and \noverwrote the ﬁle, adjusting it to ﬁt their own product. While they claimed that they just \nwanted to save on effort in formatting, a signiﬁcant amount of content from the “template” \n(the topics they had in common) was copied.\nNote for students\n: In academic exercises, unless explicitly\npermitted, the use of templates is generally \nfrowned upon given that their ready use is likely contrary to the objectives of the task. Knowledge, skills \nand attitudes can only be built by going through the process even if there is a ready answer that can be \nﬁshed from former classes or online resources.\n✔\nWhen in doubt, ask your teacher whether using some sort of template is acceptable. What you \nthink are the “industry standards” or “acceptable/common practice” are not necessarily \napplicable or suitable given learning objectives and class policies.\nSample Case 14:\nA student submitted part of his old\npaper for a previous class, to his current \nclass, without mentioning the source. He reasoned this is not plagiarism since he owns the \nmaterial himself.\n✔\nUsing your old work for current requirements is not, by itself, a problem, IF YOU CITE IT \nPROPERLY, indicating the text from where it came.\n✔\nThe larger question is whether your use of pre-existing material conforms to the objectives of the \nacademic requirement. Even if tasks are repeated across different subjects, the point is to go \nthrough the exercise, although results may be similar.\n✔\nUltimately, there may be something dishonest in passing off old product as current work.

Case 1:\nA student submitted a business plan where the survey results were falsiﬁed.\nSample Case 2:\nA reader suspected that the student\nmay have fabricated footnotes to feign \nscholarship.\nSample Case 3:\nA group of students pretended to have\ninterviewed each other for an analysis \npaper\nSample Case 4:\nA student asked his questionnaire respondents\nto lie and pretend to be his \ntarget sample.\nNote to students\n: Fabrication often involves avoiding\nwhat is perceived to be an unimportant detail in an \nassigned task. Rather than take the easy way out, students are encouraged to ask for assistance from \nthe teacher, not just in terms of methodology, but also inclarifying the importance of the seemingly \ntedious tasks in the fulﬁllment of learning objectives.\nS e c t i o n  4 :\nA p p e n d i x\nA .\nF A Q s  r e g a r d i n g\nT u r n i t i n\nQ:\nWhat is Turnitin?\nA:\nTurnitin is licensed software available for the use of the Loyola Schools. It is an internet-based \nplagiarism detection service.\nQ:\nHow does it work?\nA:\nMost faculty of the LS have Turnitin accounts where they create classes and speciﬁc requirements to \nbe subjected to the scrutiny of the program. Students will be asked to submit soft copies of their \nrequirements to the service. What Turnitin does is compare the text submitted, to its extensive \ndatabase (which includes print and online material, as well as all the papers ever submitted to it). \nGiven that comparison, it will produce a Similarity Index with an overall similarity score, as well as a \nbreakdown of the percentages of how much material from the submission is similar to what is on the \ndatabase. It will go as far as to highlight the actual passages from a student’s submission, linking it to \na located source.\nQ:\nCan Turnitin say that a paper is plagiarized or not?\nA:\nNO. Turnitin, by itself, cannot say whether a paper contains plagiarized material or not. It only matches \ntexts. Even if a sentence in a student’s paper is properly sourced, Turnitin will still highlight it as \nsomething similar to text stored in their database. It is up to the user to examine and sort what is \nﬂagged by the service, and see which highlighted sections are not sourced or inadequately attributed \nto the located sources.\nQ:\nWhat similarity score is acceptable?\nA:\nYour teacher may express that he/she will only entertain papers that fall below a certain similarity \nscore. This typically is a peg that a teacher gives in relation to how much of your text should be \n“original,” and it differs from teacher to teacher, from context to context. For example, a personal \nreﬂection paper might be given a very low threshold (e.g. 10%) because of how unique to the student \nthe material is expected to be; compared to an annotated bibliography which would, understandably, \nhave a high threshold because of the objective of the requirement (e.g. 50%). This threshold, as well \nas the actual similarity score generated for a submission, is NOT related to whether there is \nplagiarism in the paper or not.

submission (through a \nsetting in the service). Ask your teacher whether this will be enabled. However, if that is not allowed in \na particular class, there are other FREE ONLINE software that function similarly to Turnitin. You may \nalso paste the text in question in a simple Google search query which can provide signiﬁcant results.\nB .\nI m p l i c a t i o n s  o f  A c a d e m i c  D i s h o n e s t y\nAcademic integrity is at the core of the learning process. Instances of academic dishonesty naturally have \nimplications on one’s academic standing. It will also likely be reported for investigation as a disciplinary \ncase.\nIn terms of the class where the academic dishonesty was committed, at the very least, dishonest behavior \ncan be expected to merit a failing grade in the requirement involved. However, more serious cases \ninvolving major requirements (i.e. midterms, ﬁnal exams, and those that constitute 20% or more of the \nﬁnal grade), can result in failure in the course itself.\n19\nWhere there is objective evidence (e.g. the\npresence \nof a phone during a test, unauthorized notes during an exam, the black and white correspondence \nbetween the unattributed content of submission vis a vis a located source, etc.), and/or the admission of \na dishonest act, one can expect an immediate decision from the teacher regarding the academic \npenalties (i.e. the grades involved), whether or not he/she forwards the case to the Committee on \nDiscipline in addition to issuing the failing mark. In case the Committee on Discipline ﬁnds a student NOT \nguilty of academic dishonesty in the instance alleged, the student may bring said decision to the teacher \nconcerned,\n20\nor appeal for a change of grade to\nthe\nStandards Committee through the Oﬃce of the \nAssociate Dean for Academic Affairs\n21\n. In instances\nwhere the teacher deems it necessary to wait for the \ndecision of the Committee on Discipline on the matter in question before rendering any decision \nregarding a student’s grade, he/she will inform the student.\nIn those cases, the teacher may also decline to enter a ﬁnal grade for the class (manifested by an * in the \nstudent’s AISIS records) until the resolution of the disciplinary case is reached.\nFor any disciplinary complaint reported, students should refer to Section II of the\nCode of Conduct\nin the \nStudent Handbook for the processes involved. In summary, once a complaint is ﬁled, the allegations will \nbe investigated by the Oﬃce of Student Discipline. Respondents will be informed of the complaint against \nthem, and asked to submit their preliminary statements in writing, as well as any exhibits that support \ntheir claims. Based on the preliminary investigation, the Director of the Oﬃce of Student Discipline \nconducts the ﬁnal evaluation of the merits of the case, decides on the formal charges that will be ﬁled (if \nany), and forwards those with probable cause to the Committee on Discipline for hearing and deliberation.\nStudent respondents and witnesses can expect to be asked to appear in person during the hearing, after \nwhich the committee deliberates and makes its recommendation to the signatory of discipline case \ndecisions, the Associate Dean for Student Formation. It is important to emphasize that the LS does not \noperate with a formula in determining the sanction/s for a particular offense. Each incident and violation \nis treated on a case-to-case basis, but precedents are examined to address consistency and honor the \nhistoricity of discipline decisions. This result will be communicated to the student respondent when it is \navailable.\n All students of the Loyola Schools share in the communal responsibility for the preservation and defense \nof Academic Integrity.

to\nprevent harm/escalation of conﬂict \nbetween two parties, to keep order in the community.\nM a i n  d i f f e r e n c e  b e t w e e n  N C A  &  N C O\n▶\nThe\nNo Contact Agreement (NCA)\nis a non/pre-disciplinary\ntool employed by the Oﬃce for Student \nServices (OSS). It does not involve the ﬁling of a disciplinary case. It is often requested by persons \nwho want to feel a greater sense of security (through the prevention of contact, enforcement of safe \ndistances) because of a current/pre-existing safety concern, but do not want (at that time) to ﬁle a \nformal disciplinary complaint. As such, while there is a requesting party and a recipient of the NCA, \nthe contract is essentially one of mutual agreement and shared responsibility.\n▶\nThe\nNo Contact Order (NCO)\nis a disciplinary tool,\nutilized by the Oﬃce of Student Discipline (OSD) \nupon the ﬁling of a formal complaint, when a case has security/safety issues. The NCO can be an \nescalation/adoption of an existing NCA. The NCO, which is integrated into a Notice of Formal \nComplaint and/or Notice of Formal Charge, is addressed to the respondent, even as notice is also \nprovided to the complainant of mutual responsibilities/their expected cooperation with the order.

E S S A G E\nUniversity President\nMy dear Ateneans,\nWe begin another school year working and studying remotely\nfrom our homes. After more than a year of doing so, the systems\nand programs of the Loyola Schools for online learning,\nformation, and services are stronger and more vigorous than ever.\nThis revised student handbook now includes these online\nresources, as well as other information which can help make your\ncollegiate journey through the Ateneo de Manila smoother, more\nproductive, and more fulﬁlling.\nExcellence has always been an aspiration of the university, both for the programs it\noﬀers and in its students and graduates. This pertains not only to academic excellence\nbut also excellence in character and decorum. And as a Jesuit educational institution\ngrounded in the principles and values of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, this drive for\nexcellence in everything that we do is rooted in the desire to proclaim God’s glory\nthrough our actions and service.\nUltimately, this is the deeper purpose of the university’s rules and code of discipline.\nBy internalizing them and appreciating the values that they aﬃrm, may they serve as\nyour steadfast guides not only during your Ateneo journey but throughout your life’s\njourney as well.\nRoberto C .

And thanks to all the members of our community for sharing strengths, talents,\nhopes, faith, and courage.\nThese graces enabled us, together, to weather the onslaughts of heavy rains on\nﬂooded walkways, strong winds and falling debris. The same graces helped us to\ncelebrate many successes too: the glitter of sunshine on a cloudy day, a helping hand\nthat pulled us out of a muddy ground, humor with friends when we ﬁnally found a\nway out of a nasty situation, a ﬂicker of an insight that shifted our perspective away\nfrom an impasse. Many graces to be thankful for! That’s the ﬁrst order of things.\nThe second order of things is for us to move ahead. Knowing that we are all going\nback to a face-to-face mode of learning with some hybrid and online classes still for\nSY 2022-2023, we will strive to build on our positive experience from the last few\nyears and improve on what didn’t go well.\nWith this new edition of the LS Undergraduate Student Handbook, we continue to\nbe adaptive in our teaching and learning, imbued with greater hope, following the\nexample of our noble saint Ignatius of Loyola, whose conversion we commemorated\nlast year on its 500th anniversary. His cannonball experience was painful but that\npain woke him up to the reality of a greater meaning in life. With a discerning heart,\nhe left the luxurious and prestigious life of an earthly king’s soldier for the humble\nand simple life of servanthood to Christ—in faith, hope, and love.\nWith this edition of the Handbook, we remind ourselves, through Sr. Ignatius’\nvalues, that our way of proceeding is also part of a continuing communal\ndiscernment of determining what works and of deepening the principles of Jesuit\neducation. The Handbook retains information on our philosophy of education and\nour framework for online learning and teaching and what the latter entails in terms\nof teacher training and course designing.

to the enrollment in a course\nthat does not earn credit towards the \ncompletion of a degree. The units assigned to the course are meant for tuition \nassessment purposes only. While enrolled for audit, a student has access to \nlectures and course materials but does not need to complete course requirements. \nAt the end of the term, the student does not receive a letter grade for the course.\nCredit\n—refers to the enrollment in a course for which\na student earns units \ntowards a degree, minor, or specialization. Upon completion of course \nrequirements, the student receives a letter grade at the end of the term. In some \ncases, students may enroll for credit in courses categorized as “extra subjects.” \nWhile these extra subjects may not necessarily count towards a degree, minor, or \nspecialization, the grades earned are still included in the computation of a \nstudent’s Quality Point Index (QPI).\n4.1.\nAll courses that form part of a student’s program of study are graded on a \nCREDIT basis, i.e., a letter mark with a corresponding quality point value.\n4.2.\nA student may register for a subject on an AUDIT basis for those courses outside \na student’s program of study subject to the approval of the student’s home \ndepartment chair/program director.\n4.3.\nNo credit is given for courses taken on an Audit basis. No student may change \nthe grading option of a course after the deadline set by the Oﬃce of the Registrar. \nThe change of status from credit to audit, and vice versa, shall only be valid once \nthe completed load revision form is signed by the oﬃces concerned and \nsubmitted to the Oﬃce of the Registrar.\n5.\nOverload\n5.1.\nStudents are expected to enroll for the maximum load as prescribed in their \noﬃcial curriculum.

and Specializations\nDeﬁnitionS\nMinor—\nrefers to a secondary area of specialized\nacademic study, outside of the \nmajor ﬁeld, requiring fewer courses or credits than a major\nSpecialization—\nrefers to a focused area of study within the major ﬁeld, indicating \nthe content emphasis\n9.1.\nStudents may take a minor or specialization in consultation with the concerned \ndepartment chair(s)/ program director(s).\n9.2.\nA program leading to a Minor requires between 12 and 18 units in the ﬁeld of \nminor study, provided no more than 6 units are within the student’s regular \nprogram of study (i.e., the core and major curricula). Free electives may be used \nto count towards the Minor. For programs without free electives, two \nInterdisciplinary Electives can count towards the Minor in addition to the 6 units \nmentioned above.\n9.3.\nA Specialization requires at least 12 units in the focused area of study within the \nmajor ﬁeld. The Loyola Schools core and required major courses as speciﬁed in \nthe curriculum of a major program shall not be counted. Major electives \n(including the Interdisciplinary Elective-Major) and Free Electives may be used to \nqualify for the Specialization.\n9.4.\nAt least twelve (12) units leading to the Minor/Specialization must be completed \nin residence at the Loyola Schools. These twelve units are inclusive of the six (6) \nunits that may be taken from the student’s regular program of study as speciﬁed \nabove.\n9.5.\nDouble counting of courses between two Minors/Specializations is not allowed \n(i.e., a required/elective course for one Minor/Specialization may not be counted \ntowards the completion of another Minor/ Specialization). If the same course is \nrequired by a student’s second Minor Program, the student must take an \nadditional course to replace that required course.\n9.6.\nMinors and Specializations will be indicated on the transcript of records.\n9.7.\nAll courses required for the Minor/Specialization must be completed by the time \nstudents complete their Major Program.\n9.8.\nStudents may not enroll for an additional academic term to complete their Minor/ \nSpecialization after they have already graduated from the Loyola Schools.\n10.\nChange of Degree (Shifting)\nDeﬁnitions\nDegree—\nrefers to a title conferred by\na higher education institution upon the \ncompletion of a program of study.

undertakes to enroll in a \ncourse/s in another university while enrolled in a degree program of\nthe Loyola \nSchools.\n3.1.\nA student may enroll for a course(s) in another college/university subject to the \nfollowing conditions:\n3.1.1.\nThe course to be taken in another school is not a core curriculum course.\n3.1.2.\nThe course is not offered in the Loyola Schools during the particular \nsemester.\n3.1.3.\nThe total number of units of the courses registered in the Loyola Schools \nand cross-enrolled course(s) must not exceed the prescribed maximum \nload of the student’s degree program for that particular semester.\n3.1.4.\nApproval of the Home Department Chair/Program Director and approval \nof the Department Chair/Program Director who will validate the course to \nbe cross-enrolled are required.\n3.1.5.\nUnless the cross-enrolled course is to be validated as a free elective, it \nmust have an equivalent in Ateneo and can be validated for a speciﬁc \nAteneo Course Catalogue Number.\n3.2.\nEndorsement to cross-enroll in another institution does not automatically mean \napproval of validation of the course for its Ateneo equivalent.

Point Index (QPI)\n—refers to the\nweighted average, which is the measure \nof the quality of a student’s general academic performance for a regular \nacademic term.\n7.1.\nThe QPI or weighted average is the measure of the quality of a student’s general \nacademic performance for a regular academic term. The QPI determines a \nstudent's promotion to the next year level. The QPI is also one component for \ndetermining graduation or separation from the Loyola Schools. It is also used to \ndetermine semestral and graduation honors.\n7.2. The QPI is computed by:\n●\nMultiplying the quality point value of the letter grades in each course by the \nnumber of credit units in the course, and\n●\nAdding these products and dividing the result by the total number of units \ntaken during the academic term\n7.3.\nGrades in bridging and basic subjects (English 9 and 10, Filipino 10, and Math \n1.1, 1.2, and 2, and CHEM 2.20), INTACT, PE and NSTP are not included in the \ncomputation of the QPI.\n8.\nEligibility for Promotion to the next year level\nDeﬁnitions\nRegular Student\n—refers to a student who\nenrolls continuously such that one’s \nprogression from one year level to the next is aligned with the regular school \nyear.\nIrregular Student\n—refers to a student who temporarily\ndiscontinued one’s studies \nsuch that the student’s progression from one year level to the next is temporarily \nnot aligned with the regular school year.\nSchool Year\n—refers to the academic year composed of\nthe First and Second \nSemesters and the previous Intersession\nYearly QPI\n—refers to the QPI computed on the basis\nof all grades earned during a \nschool year.

The memos are arranged chronologically for easier searching.\nR e a d y  f o r  C l a s s\nThis section has some material that can help the students prepare for and manage their online \nstudies. There is a section for their learning management system (LMS), Self care (Care Kit), \nonline studies (KlikKit), among others.\nNew features on LS One are an\nFAQ section\n, a forms\nand requests\nportal\n, a\nCalendar\n, and an \nevents page\n, to name a few.\nLS One may also be found on Canvas (the LMS of the students) through a course card or through \nthe quick link on the navigation sidebar.

It is called Adaptive Design for Learning (ADL).\nThe desired adaptability refers not only to different modes of delivery of its educational services \n(online, blended, and face-to-face), but also to the course designs themselves that can be \nrepurposed to suit every individual faculty member’s style and to respond to every learner's \nunique needs and contexts. A teacher training program on Adaptive Design for Learning is \ncurrently being conducted by the Ateneo Science and Art of Learning and Teaching (SALT) \nInstitute.\nAn ADL glossary of terms was put together for your reference. For more information, please see \nateneosalt.org/adl/\nModes of Learning and Teaching\nWe will have three modes of teaching and learning in SY 2022-2023:\nO n s i t e\nThis is the regular mode of classes. The majority of contact hours will be onsite with online \ncomponents (synchronous/ asynchronous) to supplement face-to-face classes. Students who \nhave been approved for fully online classes will not be allowed to register for onsite classes\nF l e x\nThe majority of contact hours will be onsite with provisions for synchronous online participation, \nand asynchronous components.

their IDs upon entry into the Ateneo campus. It is a \nvital component of the Loyola Schools security system that identiﬁes its wearer as a \nbonaﬁde member of the Loyola Schools.\nEvery student must help in the effort to keep the campus safe for everyone by \ndisplaying his/her Ateneo ID\nvisibly and clearly\non\nhis/her person at all times\nwhile \ninside the Loyola Schools premises. This constitutes a basic act of social \nresponsibility given that campus safety and security is the responsibility of all \nmembers of the Ateneo community.\nThe ID is considered an oﬃcial school document to be treated with care and \nrespect. It is NOT to be defaced, altered, or misused in any way, shape or form. It is \nnon-transferable, not to be lent or copied, nor discarded indiscriminately.\nA.\nThe following practices are considered minor violations with the use of the ID:\n1.\nWearing the ID concealed underneath one’s clothing (shirt, jacket, etc.) or \ninside a pocket\n2.\nCarrying the ID inside a personal article, for example, a bag, notebook or \nwallet\n3.\nHanging the ID on your bag instead of wearing it on your person\nB.\nThe following are considered Major offenses with the use of the ID (meriting a \nmajor disciplinary case):\n1.\nTampering with the ID Card (i.e. defacing ID picture, putting stickers, \nchanging info)\n2.\nUsing another person’s ID or allowing another person to use one’s ID\n3.\nMaking a fake Loyola Schools student ID card\nC.\nFor one’s protection, the loss of the ID should immediately be reported to the \nOﬃce for Student Services (OSS).\nD.\nStudents who forget to bring their ID are asked to sign an ID-violation sheet and \nprovide a secondary ID as proof of identity before entering school premises. \nStudents must\nproceed directly to OSS to get a temporary\nID for the violation to \nbe nulliﬁed\n.\nFailure to do so will merit an ID violation in the student’s record of conduct, \nwhere violations are cumulative within the school year and may result in minor \npenalties or a major offense depending on the accumulated record of neglect.\nL O Y O L A  S C H O O L S  U N D E R G R A D U A T E  S T U D E N T  H A N D B O O K\nV O L U M E\n1\n46	{"source": "/root/assistant/var/contexts/prefect/Volume 1 LS Undergraduate Student Handbook 2022.pdf", "page": 45}	94b7b5f5-dff3-11ed-b3bf-971b7605698d

is sent to the student through an SMS message. If the student does not respond to \nSMS, a call slip will be sent to his/her classroom to inform them of their required test. Failure to \nrespond to the summons or taking the test on the same day of selection may be considered a \npossible offense under the Code of Discipline.\nO t h e r  I n t e r v e n t i o n s\nAlong with the Drug Testing procedure, are measures, programs and campaigns which are in \ncontinuous development, aimed\nat increasing awareness\nof the perils of dangerous drug use\n, \ntowards the greater aim of encouraging our students to\nconscientiously opt for choices that \ncontribute to their overall well-being and positive development\n. Furthermore, although \naccountability for one’s actions is always advocated\n,\nthis is to be done within the\ncontext of a \nCaring (rather than punitive) Community\n. And in cases\nwhere students are indeed found positive \nfor dangerous drugs through the random drug testing protocols, in consonance with the spirit of \nthe CHED memo that veers away from a strictly criminal approach to the drug problem among \nstudents, the Loyola Schools contends that\npunishment\nalone is an insuﬃcient response\n, and \nemphasizes the\nlevels of intervention and rehabilitation\nthat will best enable wellness\n.\nIt is actually recommended for students who have drug-related problems or are drug users, to \nrelay this to the Health Services personnel. All such concerns will be dealt with as health \nconcerns, NOT as disciplinary cases.\nStudents caught in possession of or using illegal drugs outside of this random drug testing \nprocedure have to face the consequences of their act through the disciplinary process.\nFor further information regarding the CADAP, you may inquire with the Loyola Schools Oﬃce for \nHealth Services at\nhealthservices.ls@ateneo.edu\n.\nL O Y O L A  S C H O O L S  U N D E R G R A D U A T E  S T U D E N T  H A N D B O O K\nV O L U M E\n1\n52	{"source": "/root/assistant/var/contexts/prefect/Volume 1 LS Undergraduate Student Handbook 2022.pdf", "page": 51}	94b7b5fb-dff3-11ed-b3bf-971b7605698d
